-- SQL Commands to set up your MySQL Database and Table for the C++ User Authentication System

-- 1. Create the database 'mydb'
--    This command creates a new database named 'mydb' if it doesn't already exist.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydb;

-- 2. Select the 'mydb' database
--    This command tells MySQL to use 'mydb' as the current database for subsequent operations.
USE mydb;

-- 3. Create the 'password' table with specified column details.
--    - 'Id': Stores the user identifier. It's VARCHAR(20) and designated as PRIMARY KEY,
--            which implicitly makes it NOT NULL.
--    - 'PW': Stores the password. It's VARCHAR(20) and explicitly allows NULL values.
--            (Note: While you requested a default of NULL for 'Id', a PRIMARY KEY column
--            cannot have NULL values. Its default is implicitly handled by its PRIMARY KEY constraint.)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS password (
    Id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY, -- Id cannot be NULL because it is a PRIMARY KEY
    PW VARCHAR(20) NULL         -- PW can be NULL
);

-- Optional: To verify the table was created, you can run:
DESCRIBE password;
-- SHOW TABLES;
